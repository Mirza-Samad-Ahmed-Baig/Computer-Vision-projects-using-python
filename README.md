About
Some simple computer vision implementations using OpenCV such as:

Extracting facial landmarks for facial analysis by applying filters and face swaps.
Approximating contours, contour filtering and ordering.Segmenting images by understanding contours, circle, and line detection.
Feature detection (SIFT and ORB) to do object detection and implementing dbject detection for faces and cars.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied to image.
